# JavaScript30 - Day 30: Whack-A-Mole Game

Welcome to Day 30 of the JavaScript30 challenge! In this project, we'll be creating a Whack-A-Mole game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

In this project, we'll be building a simple Whack-A-Mole game where moles randomly pop up from their holes, and the player's objective is to "whack" them by clicking on them within a certain time limit.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the game, including the holes and moles.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including mole popping and score management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd whack-a-mole-game
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The game starts as soon as the page loads.
3. Moles will randomly pop up from their holes.
4. Click on the moles to "whack" them and earn points.
5. You have a limited time to whack as many moles as possible and accumulate a high score.
6. Enjoy the game and have fun!
